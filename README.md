SplitBill is a web application developed using Angular that helps friends calculate the amount each person needs to pay after a group outing at a bar, restaurant, or any other shared expense. The project leverages the browser's cache for data storage, eliminating the need for a backend database. The application allows users to enter the total bill amount, select friends from a pre-defined list, and specify their individual expenses.

## Key Features:

1. *Calculate Fair Split:* SplitBill automatically calculates the amount each friend should contribute based on their individual expenses and divides the bill evenly among the group.
2. *Customizable Friend List:* Users can easily manage their friend list, adding or removing friends as required.
3. *Real-time Updates:* As users enter their expenses, the payment amount dynamically adjusts, providing instant feedback on each person's share.
4. *Browser Cache:* SplitBill utilizes the browser's cache to store data, ensuring that the information remains accessible even after a page refresh or browser restart.
5. *GitHub Pages Deployment:* The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing users to access and use SplitBill easily through a web browser.

With SplitBill, friends can easily split bills and ensure fair contributions without the need for manual calculations or relying on external databases. It provides a convenient and efficient way to manage shared expenses within a group, promoting transparency and simplicity in financial transactions.
